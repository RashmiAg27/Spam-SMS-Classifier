## 🚀 Project Overview

With the rise in mobile communication, spam messages have become more frequent and potentially dangerous. This project uses NLP techniques and machine learning to detect spam messages from SMS data.

The project goes beyond just building a single classifier—it compares the performance of several models including:

- **Multinomial Naive Bayes**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**
- **XGBoost**
- **Bagging, AdaBoost, Extra Trees, and Gradient Boosting**

Each model is evaluated based on **accuracy** and **precision**, helping identify which performs best on the SMS Spam Collection dataset.
