This project focuses on detecting spam SMS messages using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). The core objective is to build a reliable classifier that can distinguish between spam and ham (non-spam) messages. The dataset used is the popular SMS Spam Collection from the UCI repository.

The text data is cleaned, normalized, and transformed using TF-IDF vectorization. Multiple machine learning models are trained and compared, including Multinomial Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and ensemble methods like AdaBoost, Bagging, and Gradient Boosting.

Each model is evaluated based on accuracy and precision, and results are printed in a comparative format. This provides insight into which algorithms perform best for spam detection tasks. The project is modular, easy to extend, and serves as a solid baseline for further improvements using deep learning or deployment.
